    "### Requirement\n",
    "* **OS:** Ubuntu 14.04.x \n",
    "* **NIC:** 2 NICs  (For publick network and private network) \n",
    "* **Username:**  Each machines should be have an account with the user name \"ubuntu\".\n",
    "* **SSH keys:**  It should also have the same public ssh key saved at /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys and /root/.ssh/authorized_keys.The corresponding private key should be saved in the build directory in a file named **sshkey**.  (See section 3 for _build directory_) <br>\n",
    "* **Please update:** The commands apt-get update and apt-get upgrade should be run on each instance.\n",
